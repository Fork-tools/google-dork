# google-dork
This will grab a random dork and then save the output to a text file

This is what i use for finding all my XSS's.

Only note is the proxy is there as i use it with burp and then via tor browser socks.

You can remove this but remember google will give you the lovely capture!

I've made this using python 3 but it should work in python2.

Requires:

requests
google


easy to install

```
pip install requests google
```
